## Project Description

This project focuses on predicting monthly user churn for the Waze app. User churn quantifies the number of users who uninstall or stop using the app. The goal is to analyze user data and develop a machine learning model to predict user churn, ultimately helping Waze improve user retention and grow its business.

### Objectives:
- **Analyze and interpret user data**: Understand user behavior and identify patterns that indicate potential churn.
- **Develop a machine learning model**: Create an accurate model to predict which users are most likely to churn.
- **Generate valuable insights**: Provide actionable insights to help Waze leadership make informed business decisions.

### Key Questions:
- Who are the users most likely to churn?
- Why do users churn?
- When do users churn?

### Impact:
By identifying high-risk users, Waze can proactively engage them with special offers or interventions to improve retention. This will help optimize Waze’s retention strategy, enhance user experience, and support data-driven product development decisions. An accurate churn prediction model will not only prevent churn but also contribute to overall business growth by maintaining high user satisfaction and retention rates.

Join us in this effort to increase growth and ensure that Waze continues to provide a valuable and reliable service to its users.
